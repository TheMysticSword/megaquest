1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Welcome back to the longest-running game show|on Earth, predating humanity by...||{thinking}...I mean, I don't know how long, we didn't have|calendars back then.||{normal}A while! 
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Welcome back to Dicey Dungeons!||{sly}Let the good times roll!
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Time to get moving - a rolling dice gathers no moss!
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;It's time to rock and roll!||{thinking}Mostly roll, to be honest, unless our contestant|meets the Bully.
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Let's welcome our latest contestant back to|Dicey Dungeons!||{thinking}Tell me, do you remember sunlight?||{sly}Then you're not trying hard enough!  
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Welcome to Dicey Dungeons, where our contestants|will either win their heart's desire...||{sly}...or end up trapped for ever as my minions!||{normal}Which realistically speaking is much more likely.
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Let's welcome back our latest contestant for|another round!||{sly}Once bitten, dice shy! 
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Welcome back to Dicey Dungeons, where our|contestants' wildest dreams just might come true!||{thinking}Have you paid attention to dreams lately,|by the way?||{normal}I don't dream myself, but I'm told they're terrible.

1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;It's time for another episode of Dicey Dungeons,|where contestants risk it all in a doomed attempt|to fulfil their pitiful desires!
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Hey again everyone, and welcome back to|Dicey Dungeons!||{sly}As we say here: there's only so long you can|keep trying when you're clearly bound to fail.
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Time for another round - or maybe I should say,|another CUBE!||{sly}Another!||{sly}CUBE!      
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Let's welcome our old friend back to the dungeons!||{thinking}Wait, not friend, the other thing.||{sly}Let's welcome our hapless prisoner|back to the dungeons!
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Let's give a big hand to our latest contestant.||{sly}It's great to see you back, now and for ever!
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Thanks for joining me for another round|of Dicey Dungeons!||{sly}Tonight, let's give a big round of cruelly mocking|laughter for our miserable contestant!
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Tonight, on Dicey Dungeons:||we join together to watch an inevitable failure!
1;Warrior|Thief|Robot|Inventor|Witch;normal;Welcome back to Dicey Dungeons!||{sly}Remember, if you'd like to be on the show,|just write to us here at the Dungeons.||Don't forget to whisper your most secret hope|into the envelope!
1;Warrior;normal;Welcome back, my favourite little fighter!||Are you feeling optimistic? Imagining the deep burr|of that monster truck as you speed over the rubble?
1;Warrior;normal;Let's give a big hand for the Warrior, who's|looking great!||{sly}I guess there's always time to work out when|you're trapped in an endless dungeon.
1;Warrior;normal;Let's welcome back the Warrior, who's never gonna|win that monster truck if he doesn't work harder.||{sly}Also, he'll never win that monster truck anyway.
1;Warrior;normal;Let's welcome the Warrior back to Dicey Dungeons!||{sly}Some people just don't know when to give up.
1;Warrior;normal;Ah, it's the Warrior, my lovable buffoon!||Let's give him a round of applause!
1;Warrior;sly;Let's give a big hand for the Warrior,|my favourite contestant of all!
1;Warrior;normal;And now, entering battle again - the Warrior!||Who somehow is still trying! 
1;Warrior;normal;Let's give a thunderous round of applause|for the Warrior!||{sly}After all, he used to love thunder,|and he's never gonna hear it again! 
1;Thief;normal;It's the Thief, back for the latest episode of...|Dicey Dungeons!||Will he fulfill his dream of becoming unimaginably|rich? Probably not, but anything's possible!
1;Thief;normal;Let's welcome back my darling little Thief!||{sly}Time to STEAL yourself for another turn|in the dungeons...
1;Thief;normal;Let's give a big hand for my favourite crafty Thief!
1;Thief;normal;Welcome back, my little would-be winner!||Planning how to spend all that money? Private island,|fancy yacht, new friends to tell you that you're|definitely as clever as you think?
1;Thief;normal;Let's all give a cheer for the Thief, who's playing to win|wealth and... also more wealth?||{thinking}That's a little unimaginative, but never mind.||{thinking}You know you can wish for whatever you like, right?
1;Thief;normal;Let's give a big hand to the Thief, who is so strangely|proud of being clever and unpleasant!||Do you think he minds that I'm so much cleverer,|and so many times more unpleasant? 
1;Thief;normal;Time to welcome our Thief back to the dungeons!||I'm getting a bit sick of his sad little face. Come on,|give an extra-huge cheer if you're getting sick of|it as well!  
1;Robot;normal;Let's give a big mechanical hand for the Robot,|everyone's favourite contestant! 
1;Robot;normal;Let's welcome our Robot buddy back to the floor!||{sly}Hey, Robot: I'd like to see you optimise this... 
1;Robot;normal;Gimme a ZERO!||Gimme a ONE!||What does it spell?||{sly}Robot Fun! 
1;Robot;normal;Gimme a ONE!||Gimme a ZERO!||What does it spell?||{sly}Robot Hero!
1;Robot;normal;Let's welcome back the Robot, whose dream is to live|without sleep!||C'mon, burn your beds and replace them|with whiteboards, be the best you can be!
1;Robot;normal;Gimme a ZERO!||Gimme a ONE!||What does it spell?||{Sly}Encroaching doom and endless regret!
1;Robot;sly;Hey, do you all remember the Robot?||{normal}Let's get hyped for its inevitable failure! 
1;Robot;normal;Let's welcome back the Robot, who wants a life|without sleep!||I'm sure that extra eight hours a day wouldn't just|get filled with more doubts and desperate attempts|at self-improvement.
1;Inventor;normal;Let's welcome back the Inventor, my friend,|my favourite!||What will she get up to this time? 
1;Inventor;normal;Let's give a big hand for the ingenious Inventor,|who sometimes manages to surprise even me!
1;Inventor;normal;Let's welcome back my profligate inventor,|so easily distracted.||{sly}But will she also be... easily destructed?
1;Inventor;normal;Let's welcome back the Inventor, who wants to|understand everything!
1;Inventor;normal;Three cheers to my darling Inventor!||{sly}Come on, Inventor! Destroy the rust!||Reimagine the world while you still can!
1;Inventor;normal;It's time for another episode of hijinks with|the Inventor!||Tell me, Inventor: if you understood everything,|like you want, would you have realised that|entering the Dungeons was a bad idea?
1;Inventor;normal;Let's give a warm hand for our Inventor, who just|might be starting to run out of steam!||{sly}Would you like a suggestion, Inventor?||Here it is: maybe give up.
1;Inventor;normal;And now, the moment we've all been waiting for:||the Inventor's upcoming demise!
1;Inventor;normal;Let's welcome back the Inventor, and remind her that|the sun still shines above her.||{sly}Even if she'll never see it again.
1;Witch;normal;Put your hands together for the Witch!||Time for another magical adventure!
1;Witch;normal;Let's welcome back my wonderful Witch!||{sly}What spell will she cast on us today?
1;Witch;normal;Let's welcome back my favourite enchanting|adventurer, and the only contestant I follow|on social media - it's the Witch! 
1;Witch;normal;Let's give a big hand for our wily Witch!||She's playing to win fame and fortune - no, wait, sorry,|no fortune. Just the fame! Great choice!
1;Witch;sly;Remember the Witch?||{normal}Well, she's back, for some reason! 
1;Witch;normal;Welcome back to the stage my favourite|perennial failure, the Witch!
1;Witch;normal;Give a big cheer for the Witch,|my favourite little braggart!||Did you know her account is up|to ten thousand followers?||{sly}Well, it was until I had it deleted.
1;Witch;normal;It's time for another episode with our determined|little Witch!||She's working very hard to defeat the Dungeons|and find fame.||{sly}It's definitely possible that it'll all pay off.
1;Jester;confused;No applause, please. Silence in the hall.|There will be no cheering for traitors.
1;Jester;confused;Hey everyone! Let's all welcome back the|Jester with a long, silent stare!
1;Jester;confused;Well it's time to welcome the Jester, who has|sacrificed a high-ranking position in my dungeons|for an extremely doomed escape attempt!||Fine, I guess!
1;Jester;sly;Let's give a loud, slow clap for the Jester, who is|going to be *so* filled with regret.
1;Jester;normal;Oh look, it's the Jester!||{sly}Hey there, Jester buddy.||{sly}This isn't going to go well for you.
1;Jester;sly;It's time to welcome back a|treacherous wretch of a Jester!||Join me in quietly watching|their rapid and inevitable failure.
1;Jester;normal;Join us for another round of fun and failure|with the Jester!||{confused}As long-time viewers may recall, the Jester wasn't|always a hideous blight on all that is good and true.||But times change!
1;Jester;confused;Let's silently welcome back the Jester.||{thinking}I wonder how it feels for them to fight the brave|dungeon creatures who for so long were their|friends and allies? 
1;Jester;normal;Ah, it's the Jester, ready to play again!||And again.||And again.||{angry}There will be no end to this, Jester, not for you.
1;Jester;confused;Let's give a big round of disappointed|sighs for the Jester!
1;Jester;normal;Welcome back to Dicey Dungeons!||{sly}And here's today's contestant, who I guess|we've met before, but who even knows.||{sly}Such an unmemorable little face,|such horrible grabby hands.
1;Jester;normal;Let's welcome back to the Dicey Dungeons stage...||{confused}oh, it's you.||{confused}Go fight some monsters, you|grotesque dice-worm.
1;Jester;normal;I remember when the Jester entered the Dungeons,|a long long time ago.||{thinking}I should have sensed then this moment of betrayal.||{angry}Still, I'll make up with vindictive fury what I lacked|in foresight!
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Ah look, you've won yet another episode.||Congratulations!#But, oh no! how unexpected!||I've spun the wheel and it doesn't look like|you're taking home a prize this time...
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;You know, NONE of you contestants have|won your heart's desire yet.||What a baffling stretch of bad luck!||Anyway, it's time for one more|unlucky spin of the wheel...#Oooof, how unfortunate!||Probably next time though, right? Right!
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;You must think you've been doing SO|well at all this fighting.||So sure, stick with it!||Let's spin the wheel yet again!#Ah, how tragic.||You lose again.
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Well, I've got to give you one thing:|you're persistent.||Still thinking about your heart's desire?||Focused on that win?||Then let's set the wheel spinning!#And now let's STOP the wheel on, look|at that, another unfortunate loss...
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Ah look, here we are at the wheel again!||Let's give it a spin and see...||...whether this time, THIS time, you|might win your heart's desire.#Nope! Oh well, I'm sure things will look|up for you eventually.
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Such a persistent little dice friend!||Sure, let's give the wheel a spin, why not!#No amazing prize this time, I'm afraid.||Bad luck. Maybe it's time to just|give up for ever?
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Here to give it another whirl?||Yeah, absolutely!||This could DEFINITELY be the time that|you win your heart's desire!#Oooh, look at that!||What are the chances?
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Honestly, what would you even DO with|your heart's desire, if you won it?||No, no, sorry, silly question, let's just|get on with the wheel...#Anyway it looks like you don't need to make|any big decisions about what you would do.||At least not just yet.||Maybe next time!
