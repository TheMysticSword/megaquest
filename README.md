# Megaquest
Megaquest is a work-in-progress mod for [Dicey Dungeons](https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons) that aims to add 36 new episodes.  

### Why is the mod WIP?
The mod is technically finished (the most recent release is v2.2.0), but it doesn't work with the latest version of the game and requires switching to the "legacymods" Steam branch of the game to use the old modding API. Aside from that, some features of the mod aren't good in their current state. All things considered, the mod needs an overhaul.

### Progress
- [x] 6 Warrior episodes
- [ ] 6 Thief episodes
- [ ] 6 Robot episodes
- [ ] 6 Inventor episodes
- [ ] 6 Witch episodes
- [ ] 6 Jester episodes
